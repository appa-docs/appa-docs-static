<dt><strong>Substation</strong></dt>

<p>In the drop down menu, select the specific substation where the outage occurred.</p>

A substation is comprised of a number of incoming and outgoing circuits connected to a bus-bar system.
In addition to noting the substation, it is important to note which circuit in the specified substation was relevant to the outage.</p>
<p>In the drop down menu, select the circuit on which the outage occurred.</p>
<p class="last">Utilities can use their own naming conventions when naming their circuits (more thoroughly described in the <a class="reference internal" href="Manage.html#manage-label"><span>Manage</span></a> section of this manual).
Circuits are not automatically related to substations so be sure to use a good naming convention and select the proper circuit.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Primary Cause</strong></dt>
<dd><p class="first">In this field, there is a drop down menu with all of the causes of service interruption.
It is important to fill out the correct primary cause so that you can analyze the reasons for the outages in your utility and take preventative measures for the future.
It is also important to select the most exact cause of the outage.  For example, if there is a storm and the wind blows a tree onto a line causing an outage, the tree should be selected as the cause of the outage.</p>
<p class="last">Every service provider may categorize causes differently, but as long as you stay consistent with your own method of categorizing them, you will be able to analyze the causes of your utility&#8217;s outages in the future.
This cause list follows IEEE recommendations.
In situations where the cause of the outage is unknown, the utility should do its best to develop substantial conclusions about the most likely cause based on analysis of similar past interruption events.</p>

<p><strong>Is Partial Restoration?</strong></p>

<div><p>Partial restoration is a way to note that this recorded outage is one of several related to a single restoration event.</p>
<p>In the old eReliability Tracker, users had the option to checkmark a box to mark an outage as partially restored.

If the addition was successful, there should be a green label at the top of the page that says it was successfully added.</p>
<p>From that page, if you wish to record another outage,

<p>If you click on &#8220;Outages&#8221; sub tab you will be taken to the listing of recorded outages for your utility.
From this page, you may click on &#8220;Create an Outage&#8221; to record another outage. You can also search, edit, or delete the recorded outages.</p>
<p>When searching for an outage, all eight (8) fields you see listed across the screen will be searched as you type into the search box.
For a more detailed report you will want to use the &#8220;Export&#8221; function to create a spreadsheet.</p>
<p>On this &#8220;Outages&#8221; page, you have the ability to delete outages by placing checks next to the outages you would like to delete and then clicking on the &#8220;Bulk Action&#8221; drop down menu and selecting &#8220;Delete Selected Outages.&#8221;</p>

<p>By clicking on one of the events, you may edit the name of the event, edit any of the outages involved with the event, or sort the outages listed.
This is a good way to group partial outages together to be treated as one event in the system.</p>
<p>To sort the outages listed within an event, you have to click the boxes of those outages
that you would like to move, and click the &#8220;Bulk Action&#8221; drop down menu, and then choose either
&#8220;Separate Selected Outages into Unique Event&#8221; or &#8220;Delete Selected Outages.&#8221;</p>
