Reports are used to display data visually.  
Reports can be essential to discovering problem areas and identifying the most severe outages.


**IEEE 1366 Statistics**
 This report will provide you with: ASAI, CAIDI, SAIDI, SAIFI

**SAIDI**
 This report will provide you with your SAIDI and graph your results

**CAIDI**
 This report will provide you with your CAIDI and  graph of your results

**SAIFI**
 This report will provide you with your SAIFI and  graph of your results

**Outage Causes (Coming Soon)**
 This report will provide you with a list of outages based on if they are scheduled/unscheduled and their cause

**Circuit Ranking**
 This report will list your:
 
 * Top 10 Circuits Ranked by Customer Minutes of Duration
 
 * Top 10 Circuits Ranked by Customer Interruptions

**Cause Pie Chart**
 This report will produce a pie chart of your outages grouped by outage cause or outage duration (in minutes).

Running Reports
###############

For each type of report listed at the top of your screen, also seen to the right, you can view your utility's reliability statistics.  
Click which type of report you wish to run.  

.. image:: images/running_report.jpg

Each type of report form can be filled by basic information such as the date range you want a report from and/or 
which substation you want a report for. Once you tailor the information you want to review 
you have three options to view the data, print, download the report to a CSV file or generate the report directly on your screen. 


Report Filters
****************************

**Start Date**
 dd/mm/yyyy

**End Date**
 dd/mm/yyyy

**Remove Major Events**
 *APPA Event Threshold*
  This threshold is calculated based on outages and removes outages that exceed 
  the IEEE 2.5 beta threshold as calculated based directly on outages.

 *IEEE Day Threshold*
  This threshold is based on SAIDI-days (all of the outage events grouped together 
  by day) and removes SAIDI-days where the IEEE 2.5 beta threshold is exceeded. 
  The graph displays outage events, and after using this filter any outage event that 
  occurred starting/occurring on a day where the SAIDI-day calculation exceeds the IEEE 2.5 beta threshold is removed.

**Top Level Cause**
 Scheduled v. Unscheduled

**Minimum Event Duration (in minutes)**
 Provide the minimum number of minutes

**Maximum Event Duration (in minutes)**
 Provide the maximum number of minutes

**Substation**
 Filter based on the substations that you added to your utility profile

**Circuit**
 Filter based on the circuits that you added to your utility profile

**Report on Outage** *(Cause Pie Chart Only)*
 This report will produce a pie chart of your outages grouped by outage cause or outage 


Generating Report Results
**************************************************

For each type of report, after pressing the "\Generate Report" button, a report will show up based on the information 
that you put in to the previous screen. You can run an infinite number of reports. 

.. image:: images/saifi_results.jpg

This form is used to access reports for SAIDI, CAIFI, SAIFI, Outage Causes, Circuit Ranking, and Cause Pie Chart. 
All reports are accessed the same way by imputing basic information about the report.

The best method is to assign the new user to create his/her own account (their own username/password).  
To assign a new user use the form on the right. 
Fill out the information required and then click "\Create Registration." 
Once clicked, a green text box should appear below the "\Create Registration" button with a registration link. 
Send this link to the user that wishes to create an account. 
The new user should follow the link and fill out the required information to create an account.


NEW Features
************

**NEW!** Feature to filter transmission-related outages


To help with removing transmission related outages and/or outages due to the loss of
generating units, we were able to add a filter to the eReliability Tracker's reporting features (image below)
to allow the user to exclude those outages from their analysis.

Simply select on option or the other as shown in the image below to remove those outages from the analysis.
To remove both transmission and generation related outages, press Ctrl and click on both options. Once both
are highlighted, hit 'Generate Report' to run the analysis excluding those outages.
